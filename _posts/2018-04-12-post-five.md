title: Quick Update

Hi there just a quick update.


We have finally finished our technical prototype and are ready to finish our technical documentation. It has been a busy week putting
the final touches on the website but we are finally done. We have a meeting scheduled with Cathal to give him a demo of the prototype and we aim to have most 
of our technical documentation finished by Friday the 20th of April to give us time to study for our final exams.

The project is now live at icohub.eu if you want to have a look for yourself.
