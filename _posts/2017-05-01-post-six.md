title: The final submission
---

Hi There,


This week on the 4th of may is our final submission for the digital copy of our report.
Our report contains a fully realised business plan alongside a technical document which contains
information on how we built our project.


Last week me and Evan put the finishing touches to the document and combined all of our headings, finishing the final layout of the report.
After spending two full days reading over the report and doing spell and grammar checks. Our report is finally finished alongside our website.


We sent this onto Cathal yesterday for him to give us some feedback before the official submission on Friday.

Hopefully we will only have to make a few changes and the project will be finished this friday.


See you next timeline


-Aaron
