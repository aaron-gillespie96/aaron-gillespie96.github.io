title: The final submission
---

Hi There,


This week on the 4th of may is our final submission for the digital copy of our report.
Our report contains a fully realised business plan alongside a technical document which contains
information on how we built our project.


Last week me and Evan put the finishing touches to the document and combined all of our headings, finishing the final layout of the report.
After spending two full days reading over the report and doing spell and grammar checks. Our report is finally finished alongside our website.


We sent this onto Cathal yesterday for him to give us some feedback before the official submission on Friday.

This was approved and we made our digital submission in pdf format.Now all we have to do is present our idea on the 22nd of may and we will be finished. We will now be taking a small break from ICOHub to finish our exams.

See you next time

-Aaron
