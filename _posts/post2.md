title: Some updates from February!

Over the last few weeks we have been developing our technical delivery for our final year project. In this
blog I am going to outline the tasks I have completed so far towards the technical delivery. Evan has been working on
the front end of the website so I have been focusing most of my effort on the back end.

##Domain Name##

To begin the building of the back end I first purchased a domain name from www.namecheap.com. We were unable to buy icohub.com so we
instead decided on using icohub.eu


##Server hosting##
