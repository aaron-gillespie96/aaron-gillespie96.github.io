title: Mid-Term Delivery
---

Hi Again,

Sorry for the lack of updates after we presented our project proposal we went straight into exams which took up most
of the Christmas period.

Since the last update we presented our project to Cathal Gurrin and Markus Helfert who were both very happy with our
idea and gave it their approval. Cathal also agreed to be our project supervisor. We were happy with this as he was the one
who helped us come up with our idea at the beginning of the project development process.

Over the Christmas break we have been working on our mid-term delivery which we will submit later on this month. We also developed a large portion of our
business plan which spans about 60 pages. This means the primary focus of semester two will be our prototype and technical delivery.


Thanks for reading and ill see you next time.
