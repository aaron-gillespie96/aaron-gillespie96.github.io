Hi and welcome to my blog. This blog will be used to document the process of developing my final year project.
Currently me and Evan have held a series of meetings to discuss ideas for our final year project.

Our Idea
---------------

The spec we were given by the college means that we can develop any idea we like and will have to develop a
functional prototype along with a fully realised technical document and business plan.

We had a few ideas between us and originally thought of developing a social network for start-up companies to
contact investors. We met with our lecturer Cathal Gurrin to discuss this idea and he asked us could we
possibly integrate the blockchain into the idea.

We took that feedback and came up with an website that allows startup companies to set up their own ICO with no
blockchain knowledge. We will call this website ICOHub


What is an ICO ?
---------------

An ICO also known as an Initial Coin Offering and sometimes called a crowdsale is when a startup company releases its own cryptocurrency known as a token that acts like a share in the company. The startup releases a set number of tokens in exchange for capital. Each token has a set value and is worth a percentage of the company like a stock on the stock market. As a result, the startup company gets a large amount of investment capital, and the investors get a stake in the company and can sell these shares at any time through online exchanges.


How can we simplify this process ?
---------------
ICOHub is an online platform that will provide investors with a centralised place to browse and invest in ICO’s. ICOHub aims to provide a range of free services to investors such as an investment portfolio and an online wallet to store their ICO tokens. It will allow startups who are holding their own ICO to sign up and create their own personalised advertisement. These advertisements will be then advertised on our platform to investors. Each advertisement will display a brief description of the startup's new project, members involved and how much of the company is at stake for investors to invest. Investors can then browse available ICO’s and invest in companies that they see potential in. We plan on targeting two key target markets Startup companies who are looking to gain investment and investors who want to get involved in the growing cryptocurrency market. In this business plan, we explain how we will market and sell to these customers through social media, conferences and our own website. We also explain our internal company structure from a management and financial view.  


Thanks for reading my first blog post. This week we will submit our project proposal to both Cathal Gurrin and Markus Helfert to get their approval.
