title: Lets talk about organisation !

Background:
---------------

Due to it being a two-person project over the space of a year the project involved a high degree of collaboration.
Time management was required due to the fact we also had additional modules which we meant we had to divide our time between the project and other final year modules.
To adequately divide our time, we took ideas from the Kanban and agile methodologies and modified them to suit our needs.

Tools:
---------------

We used a series of collaboration tools to help us work together even when we were working remotely and alone.

Slack:
---------------


We first started using Facebook messenger to collaborate but that was unprofessional and messy, so we set up a slack account for our
project. This allowed us to have different channels for different areas of the project such as #planning and # security.


We used the following bots in our slack setup


Github bot: This pushed any of our GitHub commits to a slack channel, so everyone was notified of the changes.


Trello Bot: This pushed all our changes on the Kanban board to a slack channel called #planning.


Due to its mobile and desktop applications slack allowed us to keep updated with each other on the go. We were also able to participate in screen shares this was particularly useful when working at home and you were stuck. This allowed for both team members to work on a problem together.

Trello:
---------------

Trello is a web-based project management application that allows you to create tasks and assign users to tasks.
Our board is broken up into four lanes which help organise our tasks.

Backlog: These are tasks that have to be completed but are currently not being worked on by either team member.


Dev+Test: These are tasks that are currently being worked on by team members.


Ready to release: These are tasks that are completed but need to be agreed by both team members that they are “Done”
Done: Completed tasks.

Source code management: GitHub
---------------


We used GitHub for our source code management. Due to the fact we are using GitHub for educational purposes we were able to acquire and academic account meaning we could use GitHub premium features for free. This meant our GitHub repo is private and only accessible by us.


Both of us use GitHub desktop and commit our changes daily. This means we both work from the same codebase and don’t need to re-download the code from our server manually after someone makes a change.
