title: Proposal Presentation
---
Hi, Aaron here once again.

Last week we submitted our project proposal document and it was approved with very good feedback.
We now have to complete a presentation of our idea to Cathal Gurrin and Markus Helfert before we can
start working on it. Once that is done we look forward to beginning the business plan and mid term delivery.

We have already started working on some market research to prepare for this but the project will officially begin after the proposal presentation.

See you next time.
