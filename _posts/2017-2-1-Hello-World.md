title: Semester 2 lets get started!
---
We are back in college after our winter exams and are now beginning to develop the technical portion of our delivery. Before our exams we submitted our mid-term delivery which included our plans for our delivery in may 2018. In summary we plan on delivering

•	A prototype website including

    •	Homepage


    •	Token Creator


    •	Sample startup profile


    •	Sample investor profile


•	A technical document.


•	A full business plan.


We developed the majority of our business plan in semester one producing a 60 page document conforming to Enterprise Ireland standards.
This semester we plan on focusing on the technical side of our project. After a meeting today we have decided on our final design for the website and are in the process of researching our development technologies (bootstrap and javascript) and we are starting to build our homepage prototype.
